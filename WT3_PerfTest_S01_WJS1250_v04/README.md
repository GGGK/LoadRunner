This repository contains a sample script coded in <strong>JavaScript</strong>

Technologies such as this requires some explaination.
So we conduct 2-day classes on this at StarEast and StarWest
as well as on-line.

Contact me on Skype (wilsonmar4) 
or the <a target="_blank" href="https://gitter.im/wilsonmar/LoadRunner/">
