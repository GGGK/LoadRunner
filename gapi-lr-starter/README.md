This script is referenced during on-site live hands-on courses.
The script is called starter because it contains use of many of the constructs needed in real scripts in productive use.

The preference is to place documentation in the script itself rather than in an external documen like this one.

This document is used to speculate on future enhancements, written as if the code has already been developed,
so it can be inserted in the script.
